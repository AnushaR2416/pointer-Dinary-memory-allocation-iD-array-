/*

Few of the students in a class started playing game during their leisure hour. In this game, there were cards with numbers written on it. Each person need to pick 2-cards from this set. The two-cards are denoted as A and B. The goal of the game is to modify the value of A and B. A should be modified as absolute sum of A and B and B should be modified as absolute difference between A and B. The resultant A and B should always be positive.

Write a program to find the modified values of A and B to accomplish this goal using functions and pointers.

Function specifications:
void changeValue(int *a, int *b)
This function changes the value of A and B as per problem description.
 
Input Format:
Input will contain two integers, A and B.
 
Output Format:
Print the updated value of A and B.
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

Sample Input:
5
7
Sample Output:
12
2
