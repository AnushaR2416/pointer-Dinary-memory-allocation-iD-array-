/*

Jack is a farmer and he had planted many crops in his farm few months ago. All the plants are well grown now(denoted as upper case alphabets) and now he is planting few more new crops again (denoted as small letter alphabets). Now he wants to find how many types of crops are there in the farm because he wants to get pesticides for different crops. For example, if there are 2 well grown potato plants(PP) and 3 small potato plants (ppp) , all the plants together will be counted as 1 plant type. Help him by writing the program to find how many plant types are planted .

Logic is case-insensitive.
